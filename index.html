      <p class="text-muted">From 1998 to 2023, the school cafeteria has served millions of students,
      tolerated their messes and accidents, and gave them a place to talk and laugh. First opened on
      the school's first mid year festival, the beautiful cafeteria had shone and sparkle, and served
      healthy meals for hungry students after their lessons. But after surviving over 20 years of students
      in 2018, the place needed cleaning up. But with the help of the student council, and the clean up crew,
      the school was able to make the cafeteria prettier than it's ever been.

      big enough to destroy half of the place. But this year, we have a newly reinnovated auditorium, that is
      more wonderful than ever!

      books, and listen to a story read by the librarian.

      Who knew faulty Christmas lights could destroy half of our historic 20 year old Auditorium. No one
      did, in fact, when one peaceful morning, the fire alarm rang crazily. All the students thought
      it was a normal drill, but our brave janitor, Mr. Mackleroy, knew something was fishy. He spotted a
      little first grade girl near the fire alarm puller, who is known as our hero, Reyna Backdrop. But before he 
      could confront her, Mr. Mackeroy saw thick black smoke floating from the cracks of the auditorium
      door. He lifted Reyna, saw the flames, and hurried outside, where the other people were. He notified,
      the firemen where the fire was, and the fire was put out before it damaged the whole auditorium. But
      the auditorium looked very damaged, and it wasn't safe to enter. That meant no Christmas performances,
      or special Christmas movie days. It was a disappointing 2019 Christmas. But thankfully, now, we have
      renovvated and finally fixed the auditorium, and classrooms around it that got damaged. That means,
      we will finally have programs for Christmas 2023!

      A tragedy happened a few years ago to two of the students at our school. Sarah and Wilfred Banks,
      who lived around 10 minutes from the school, were walking to school, when they were abducted by
      a man driving a strange sportscar. Their teacher thought that they were sick or they were just absent,
      but because she knew that they usually walk to school, she checked with the principal. He had got no
      phone calls from their parents, and quickly contacted them. The worried parents notified the school
      that the siblings had left the house two hours ago. Immiediatly the school contacted the police, and 
      checked the roadside camera, which had capture the two kids walking two hours ago, and how they
      had gotten into a sportscar. They found the license plate of the car a day later, and tracked it down
      to an abandoned cabin at the edge of the town. There the police discovered other kidnapped kids, and 
      returned them to their homes. From that day on, parents walked with their children, and the school,
      invented a clever system, in which parents will notify the school if their children are absent,
      and the school will notify the parents when the child arrives at the school, if they are not absent.
      Otherwise they will call the parents, and then alert the police.
